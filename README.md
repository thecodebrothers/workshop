This repository hosts a groceries demo application creatively called _Groceries App_.

## Getting Started

1. In the root folder, bootstrap the app

   ```bash

   ```

1. In the `widgetbook` folder, run Widgetbook

   ```bash
   flutter pub get                 # Install deps
   dart run build_runner build -d  # Generate files

# Setup

Make sure to have completed the following setup before the workshop starts. 

## Flutter

Make sure you have Flutter 3.35 / Dart 3.9 installed.

## Setup IDE

Setup Cursor, if you've already used the free trial, try another email. 

Note: If you don't have access or don't want to use Cursor, you can use VS Code + Copilot + Claude Sonnet instead. 

## Setup Doc Indexes

1. In the bottom add the following docs to index
   - `https://docs.widgetbook.io` 
   - `https://pub.dev/documentation/widgetbook/latest/widgetbook/`

Note: This might take some time. 

## Setup MCP servers

1. In Cursor go to Settings > Cursor Settings > MCP & Integrations
1. Click the "New MCP Server" button at the bottom of the page to open Cursor's mcp.json file
1. Insert the following code

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Widgetbook MCP": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3013/mcp"
    },
    "Figma MCP": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp"

      "command": "dart",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note: MCP servers for VS Code are pre-defined in `.vscode/mcp.json`.

We created pre-defined cursor rules (`.cursor/rules`) for the workshop. 
These rules are not automatically applied. 
You can check them out in advance. 

Note: If you're using VS Code you can find the rules in `.github/prompts`.
